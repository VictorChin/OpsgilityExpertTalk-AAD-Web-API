    /// Wrapper class around the ASP.NET Core ILogger to enable assertion with NSubstitute because ILogger internally uses an internal struct FormattedLogValues which can't be mocked.
    /// In the Log method, the generic type parameter is forced to be an Object, which can then be matched by NSubstitute.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <see cref="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger"/> has only one logging method - Log.
    /// LogDebug, LogInformation, LogError, etc. are actually extension methods located in <see cref="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.LoggerExtensions"/>, which all end up calling the Log method in the ILogger.
    /// Since extension methods are concrete, NSubstitute cannot mock them. 
    /// Subsequently Log method should be mocked; however, LoggerExtensions class passes a FormattedLogValues internal struct to the Log method.
    /// This prevents NSubstitute from successfully matching the method calls by parameters.
